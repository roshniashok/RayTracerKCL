## RayTracerKCL :

This project is part of the group project that is to be implemented in King's College London.

Ray Tracing is a rendering technique which takes simple 2D objects such as circles, squares or rectangles and produces a 3D rendering of these objects in the form of spheres, cubes, cuboid etc. We have implemented a Raytracer using this raytracing technique.

Middle East group is a group made of 6 members :

* Roshini Ashokkumar 
* Nandhini Sreekumar
* Norah Alsuwily
* Tamanna Qureshi
* Sara Alotaibi
* Maryam Yasin

We have used C++ for the implementation of the front and the backend and used QTCreator for the front-end.

## Execution Instructions

	Have the Project Folder RayTracerKCL stored on your Desktop
	So that the Scene.txt will always be saved in the directory:
		C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTracerLinker
		Download debug.zip folder from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V0J4rM9eGbainumFdVNG4ta_tDBhea0-
			 and libstdc++-6.zip from https://drive.google.com/open?id=10vOvQHX8YaObEu4taB3iXnnelYNlLDhm
			 and extract it into C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTracerLinker directory

## From the RayTracerLinker
1. Go to the directory C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTracerLinker
2. Double click on the RayTracerLinker jar file
3. While it running select the Draw Image to run the front end and select the inputs you desire and then hit the save button
4. After closing the front end select the Render Image button for the backend to render the image
	5. Type your desired file width height and name for the image
6. Return to the C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTracerLinker directory and select the image file of the name you have described
		
## From the Front-End
1. Install QT 
2. Load QT
3. Open File
4. Select the folder RayTraceFrontEnd in C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceFrontEnd
5. Copy all the files into the QT program
6. Press the run button
7. Select any values you want for each drop down menu
8. Press save when happy with the image you want 
9. Go to the C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTracerLinker to view your text file
10. Then implement the backend following the backend instructions bellow


## From the Back-End

 - If you have all the necessary C++ files installed and added to your systems environment variables:
   - Double click on the RayTrace3.exe file in the directory 
		C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceBackEnd
		
- Otherwise:

1. Install CodeBlocks 
2. Go to C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceBackEnd
3. Double click on the RayTrace3 project 
4. Wait for it to load up
5. Click the Build and run button in CodeBlocks 
6. Go back to the folder in C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceBackEnd
7. View the Scene.png picture
